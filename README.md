# Assignment_1
Work for GEOG5003 Assignment 1

This contains three files to complete Assignment 1.

The first file is called agentframework.py. This file contains coding to generate the Agent class, which enables agents to move within their environment, eat their environment
which is contained within a store. Agents can share their stores with neighbours within a specified distance.

The second file is in.txt. This contains the numbers used for the x and y co-ordinates for 100 agents.

The third file is model.py. This file creates the agents and their environment, and runs through the agentframework.py file multiple times causing the agents to move and eat
within the environment. The code also creates a window with an animated figure depicting the agents' locations within the environment. The file will generate a run time and
produce the agents' initial and final co-ordinates and store values.


Download the three files to the same directory and run the model.py file to create the agent based model.
